            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Enzo Bruzzone Salcedo, a Civil Engineering student at Manhattan College with a minor in Mathematics. I am passionate about engineering and environmental sustainability, and I enjoy working on projects that challenge me and allow me to apply my skills in real-world scenarios. My interests include transportation engineering, structural analysis, and community service, which I actively engage in through various organizations and projects.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="projects" class="section">
            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <h3>Civil Engineering Course Project</h3>
            <p>At Manhattan College, I worked on a project involving the surveying of a parking lot, designing brick walls for the Higgins Engineering and Science Center, and calculating heat loss for the building. We utilized Electronic Distance Measurement (EDM) instruments for accurate data collection and focused on precise surveying techniques to ensure the quality of our design and analysis.</p>
            <h3>Transportation Engineering Course Project</h3>
            <p>Led a team in analyzing traffic patterns at the Mosholu Parkway and Paul Avenue junction in the Bronx, NY. We used Poisson models to predict traffic scenarios and evaluated lane capacity. Our analysis showed that the lane was underutilized even during peak hours, suggesting potential for optimization. This project enhanced my skills in data analysis, traffic engineering, and team leadership.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="experience" class="section">
            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <h3>Halmar International - Estimating Engineer Intern</h3>
            <p>During my internship at Halmar International, I gained hands-on experience in project estimation and tunnel engineering. I contributed to significant tunnel projects, analyzed designs, learned excavation methods, and estimated quantities of rock bolts. This role provided a comprehensive understanding of Heavy Civil Construction and Estimating.</p>
            <h3>Keller - Field Engineer Mentee</h3>
            <p>Collaborated on concrete sampling and testing procedures, performing Concrete Slump Tests and concrete batch sampling. This experience provided valuable insights into Civil Engineering and Field Engineering workforce dynamics through the Manhattan College Mentor Program with Keller.</p>
            <h3>Manhattan College Fitness Center - Front Desk Staff</h3>
            <p>Excel in delivering exceptional customer service and maintaining an efficient facility. Responsibilities include equipment maintenance, safety inspections, and emergency response. Managed equipment setup and access control, creating a safe and welcoming environment for the college community.</p>
